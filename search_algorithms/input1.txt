# scenario where the binary constraints cannot be met together. Therefore there is no solution
#definition of the tasks
task, t1 2
task, t2 5
task, t3 7
task, t4 4
# three binary constraints (the first two constraints cannot be met together
constraint, t2 same-day t3 
constraint, t2 starts-at t3
constraint, t1 after t4
# domain constraint 
domain, t1 starts-before wed 10am
# soft deadlines
